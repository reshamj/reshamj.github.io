      I'm currently an Software Engineer at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank"></a> building things for the web with some awesome people. I recently graduated from
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">California State University</a> after completing  awesome internship at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">Belkin U.S.</a>,

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably reading, hiking around,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
